# hgrv_method
The datasets, algorithms, and Python3 code associated with [Holzer et al. (in prep)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14083). The methods are also implemented in the R package [rvmethod](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rvmethod). Anyone is welcome to use the datasets, algorithms, and code, but please cite this paper when doing so.

There are three main folders, each containing Jupyter notebooks that give interested readers a more hands on understanding of each portion of the paper. Each folder also contains its own README file that gives a more detailed description of its contents. 

The folder AbsorptionFeatureFinder_algorithm contains files and code for Algorithm 1 in Section 2 that finds absorption features in a spectrum from a unsupervised statistical heuristic. HGRV_theory contains files relating to the mathematics of a Doppler-shifted Gaussian as described in Section 3 of the paper. SimulationStudies contains the results for the two simulations studies in Section 4 of the paper. And 51Pegasi contains the extracted spectra from EXPRES and the code used to analyze them with the HGRV method in Section 5 of the paper. Please cite the paper [Petersburg et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08851) when using these spectra.
