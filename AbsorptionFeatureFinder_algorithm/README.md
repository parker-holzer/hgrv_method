This folder contains code and data for applying the Absorption Feature Finder algorithm, referred to as Algorithm 1 in [Holzer et. al (2021)](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-statistics/volume-15/issue-2/A-HermiteGaussian-based-exoplanet-radial-velocity-estimation-method/10.1214/20-AOAS1406.full), to the NSO spectrum. The overall function that performs the algorithm is found in the file "spectra_functions.py". The raw version of the NSO spectrum is given in the file "nso_spectrum.txt" and a reduced version of it is given in "NSOspec.csv". Two Jupyter notebooks are included: "Find NSO Features.ipynb" and "Analyze AFF Algorithm.ipynb". The first applies the algorithm to the NSO spectrum with the results given in the file "Features.csv". The second analyzes the false positive rate and true detection rate with the parameters used on the NSO spectrum. For the false positive rate, the overall results were produced with the python script "aff_falsepositives.py" which parallelized the computation.
