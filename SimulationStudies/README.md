This contains the results for the two simulation studies in Section 4 of [Holzer et. al (2021)](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-statistics/volume-15/issue-2/A-HermiteGaussian-based-exoplanet-radial-velocity-estimation-method/10.1214/20-AOAS1406.full). The first of these is the template estimation simulation. The smoothed NSO spectrum that has the same wavelength solution as an EXPRES spectrum is in the file *smoothednso_expres.csv*. The R code used to perform the simulation is in the file *hgrv_temp_est.R* and the results are analyzed in the Jupyter notebook *TemplateEstimation.ipynb*. 

The second simulation is the RV-precision of the HGRV as compared to the CCF. The file *rvprecision_ccf.py* contains the code used to simulate and estimate the RV with the CCF as implemented in the EXPRES pipeline. The Jupyter notebook *RVprecision_simulation.ipynb* contains the code that simulates and estimates the RV with the HGRV. It also analyzes the results of the RMS, Variance, and Bias.

The study of the model misspecification due to assuming absorption features are Gaussian-shaped is also included in the Jupyter notebook *Model Misspecification.ipynb*, which uses the NSO spectrum in *NSOspec.csv*.
