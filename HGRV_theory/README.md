This folder contains two Jupyter notebooks that are designed to give a better understanding of the math behind the [HGRV method](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-statistics/volume-15/issue-2/A-HermiteGaussian-based-exoplanet-radial-velocity-estimation-method/10.1214/20-AOAS1406.full). The two files are "Hermite-Gaussian coefficients math.ipynb" and "Multiple Features Test.ipynb". The first gives the coefficient solutions of Lemma 2 as well as the standardized approximation error whose limit is given in Theorem 1. The second gives the reader an opportunity to test what radial velocities and parameters for a Gaussian absorption feature allow for the problem to be reduced to simple linear regression.
